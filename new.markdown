Welcome to Speakcloud! Weâ€™re a one-man consultancy firm that specializes in workshops for people looking to begin or expand their knowledge of cloud infrastructure, DevOps, Serverless technologies, and Python programming. Our workshops are designed to equip our clients with the necessary skills to take full advantage of today's cutting-edge technology stacks, so they can maximize efficiency while staying agile and well-informed on industry best practices.

Our unique approach combines traditional workshop teaching concepts with personalized mentorship as an ongoing commitment once the course has come to an end. This provides you with all relevant resources and support materials, ensuring successful adoption long after each session ends. Plus, every project finished under us comes alongside detailed strategic analysis reports from which key trends and insights can be extracted at any given time leading up towards greater decision-making capabilities down the line. This is something most other companies simply don't offer, providing a much higher added value proposition than expected by default standards within this field.

Our lead consultant, Stu, is a highly experienced and qualified professional in the field of cloud infrastructure, DevOps, Serverless technologies, and Python programming. With 12 years of experience and all 12 AWS certifications, Stu is well-equipped to guide you through the complexities of today's technology stacks.

If you're ready to take your skills to the next level, email us at [stu@speakcloud.consulting](mailto:stu@speakcloud.consulting) or drop us a message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/speakclouder). We'd love to hear from you and help you on your journey to becoming a cloud infrastructure, DevOps, Serverless technologies, and Python programming expert.
