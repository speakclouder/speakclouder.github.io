I gave the OpenAI API the lowdown on what SpeakCloud it intends to be, with the following parameters: 

```
array (
  'prompt' => 'Speakcloud is a one man consultancy firm which runs workshops for people looking to improve their devops, serverless, AWS and Python knowledge. Can you write an about page for them.',
  'ai_model_id' => 8, # text-davinci-003
  'max_tokens' => 500,
  'temperature' => 85,
  'top_p' => 100,
  'n' => 1,
  'stream' => 0,
  'echo' => 0,
  'presence_penalty' => 100,
  'frequency_penalty' => 100,
  'best_of' => 1,
  'suffix' => NULL,
)  
```

and this is the reply I got (some tiny edits): 

Welcome to Speakcloud! We’re a one man consultancy firm that specialises in workshops for people looking to begin or expand their knowledge of cloud infrastructure, DevOps, Serverless technologies and Python programming.

Our goal is simple: To equip our clients with the necessary skills needed to take full advantage of today's cutting edge technology stacks so they can maximise efficiency while staying agile and well-informed on industry best practices. Whether you are just getting your feet wet or want more advanced guidance into topics like DevOps automation pipelines or AWS architecture design principles - we've got it covered!

Our unique approach combines traditional workshop teaching concepts with personalised mentorship as an ongoing commitment once the course has come to an end; this provides you will all relevant resources & support materials ensuring successful adoption long after each session ends. Plus every project finished under us comes along side detailed strategic analysis reports from which key trends & insights can be extracted at any given time leading up towards greater decision making capabilities down the line — something most other companies simply don't offer thus providing a much higher added value proposition than expected by default standards within this field .
