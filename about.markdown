### Hello! I'm Stu Mason, founder of _speakcloud_, a Solutions Architect and DevOps specialist consultancy

I have a background in development and a passion for the cloud. I am a huge proponant of serverless and enjoy getting my head around complex security, monitoring and automation challenges.

Right now, I'm working with one of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies, enabling their developers get to production often, fix bugs quickly and experiment with new features by iterating (_read: failing_) fast.

Ask me about serving Laravel with Lambda + APIGateway, load testing serverless compute microservices, monitoring fargate based workers or how the DORA 4 key metrics can _change your development life forever_.

You can reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/speakclouder)
