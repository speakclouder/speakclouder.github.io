Hello! I'm Stu, a qualified AWS Solutions Architect and DevOps professional with over a decades worth of experiance, based (near...) the southern most tip of the UK.

I am a consultant with an expertise in cloud architecture and automation. My background is in development, namely PHP, Laravel and Python - but my true passion is for AWS and all things cloud.

Right now, I'm working with one of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies, enabling their developers get to production often, fix bugs quickly and experiment with new features by iterating (read: failing) fast.

I am a huge proponant of serverless and love getting my head around security, monitoring and observability challenges.

Ask me about serving Laravel through Lambda + APIGateway, load testing serverless compute, running Fargate based workers using EvenBridge rules (alerting when they report a non-zero exit code) or how the DORA 4 key metrics can change your development life forever.

You can reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/speakclouder)
