I've been meaning to set this site up for a long while now, it's taken me too long to get round to it (is 6 years too long?).

In the past I've fought with github pages (what hosts this site) and I've lost many battles with Jekyll - I think because a) I ain't a ruby dev and b) I'm always trying to change the theme too much, add too much of my own styling, and generally make a mess of things. Too much tinkering (procrastination...).

When I allow myself the time to think about why it's taken me so long to finally get this site up, I always come to the same conclusion - I allow myself to do the "easy" things - work, play, procrastinate. I fight with (and regularly lose to) with my resistence to doing the hard things. The things I _know_ will benefit me in the long run. 

## Writing

It's something I'm doing more and more lately, and it's helping a great deal - however, it's really quite hard. It requires a ton of brain power and I also find it's where I hit the biggest resistance. Perhaps that means I know how important it is.

Writing solidifies my knowledge and weedles out the gaps - I have to understand something in it's entirety before I can write about it - whether it's a new piece of tech, a new way of doing things, or a new way of solving a problem. I have to understand it, and I have to be able to explain it to a five year old. If I can't do that, I don't understand it enough to write about it.

It generates new ideas and pathways to explore - The more I write, the deeper I will go into a topic, and the deeper I go, the better my understanding is. The better my understanding, not only can I write about it more, I can quickly map new ways to solve problems or use tech. I can see the connections between things.

It creates content and showcases my talent. I can be very much lurking in the shadows - I have a tendancy to sit in the back, not put my hand up, and focus on getting shit done. I don't like meetings, I don't like email threads or big group threads in slack (that's not to say I don't enjoy working in a team, I also love pairing - it is _the_ best way to develop, espcially to learn). I think perhaps I don't like confrontation or politics, and large meetings or discussions where many expert developers are bringing with them their own strong opinions and ideas can lead to fairly heated discussions which I'd rather have in a more private setting.

So writing, one of my biggest creators of resistence, is one of my biggest focus points at the moment. Write more. In order to write more, I need to learn more, which brings me on to

## Learning

I genuinely love learning (who doesn't), and I love that there is just so much content out there in so many different mediums that it's very easy to find the exact thing I am looking to learn in the exact medium I want to learning - whether it's an article, a blog post, a tutorial, a video, a course. Someone will have made it.

But again, I have resistence to this. I will very easily fall back into my old ways of doing things, stay in the rut where things can get done well, and quickly, and reliably - but I'm not learning anything new, I am not pushing myself to improve. No challenge, no growth - a bit of a rut.

The more I learn, the more time I spend listening, not talking or working, the better my talking and working gets. But again, it's hard. I have deadlines to meet, and getting work done is always my priority number 1. Perhaps I am taking on too much?

<!-- ## Saying No

Say. no. more. How simple is that? I have a huge resistence to this. I even find myself offering to help people when I know I shouldn't be. My workload is too big because of this, I am under pressure and stretched, which means the writing and learning take a back seat.

I was not focusing _enough_ on the important. Perhaps now I've come to realise this, after mulling on it for 6 short years, I can start to focus on the important things, and let the unimportant things go. -->
