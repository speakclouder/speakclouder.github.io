For years I spent too much time hating the fact that I was intimidated by other “better” developers. There was always someone on the team, or the adjacent team, who terrified me.

At first, I struggled with it. I loathed being the dumbest person on the team. I used to despise sitting in meetings and understanding things the slowest, taking ages to catch on to what was being discussed. Asking questions that seemed (and sounded) plain dumb.

I would rarely ask the intimidating developers questions. The intimidators wouldn’t know their role in my life, and they would (usually) be the friendliest and most helpful people on the planet.

When I absolutely had to ask them something - when all the people I would openly be an idiot in front of were exhausted and everyone was telling me to ask them, then I would write the question out as detailed as possible.

Then I would look at the question and know that I couldn’t post that, it was too dumb - it lacked context, it didn’t use the right technical words, it was vague and it showed a clear lack of understanding.

I’d re-write it, re-arrange it, google things I didn’t quite understand fully over and over until I was happy with the question I was about to ask them.

And every time I did this, something happened.

Putting the question together like this, for the intimidating developer, I would learn more about the problem that I thought I could know, and most of the time come to the solution.

Meaning just their presence was enough for me to up my game. They were my secret mentor.

These intimidating devs never realised how long I lurked in their DM’s, posing these questions effectively to myself. Moving to notes or notion in case I accidentally hit enter and sent an unfinished, unpolished question.

This is slightly different to “rubber ducking”, as rubber ducking is to explain the problem to someone (or some inanimate thing) that has no idea what you’re talking about, you’re simplifying the problem as far down as you can possibly go. You’re aiming down in order to gain that in depth knowledge.

Also, that poor duck hasn’t got a fucking clue what you’re on about, so even if you explain it as clearly as you think is possible, you can both still be completely wrong. Especially the fucking duck.

But Rubber mentoring, not only have you stretched your understanding of the problem as far as you think you can, you’ve ended up with a very polished question at the end of it that you can send off to the intimidating developer - or a github issue, or stack overflow, or chattipy.

Nowadays I long to be the dumbest person in the room (which, thankfully, is still more often than not) and I lookout for that intimidating developer, I lurk in their DM’s writing, polishing, learning, improving.

If I’m the smartest person in the room, I’m in the wrong room.
